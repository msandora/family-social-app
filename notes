Hello community, 

I thank you in advance for reading this and I hope that you might contribute in a meaningful way.

I joined this community because I believe as an American voter I need to be informed on other peoples perspectives, especially if I disagree with them. I joined this community in hopes of better understanding the appeal of the Trump Presidency.  I would like to see a bright future for my country and for our children. Unfortunately, I do not. I find the events of the last few years to be very concerning. 

Before I continue, I want you to know...
- I consider myself a progressive independent who leans left. 
- I relate to some Conservative talking points and while I may disagree on some things, I get where these people are coming from... sometimes.
- I lean left because I feel it is more likely that progress will be made with Democrat in office. One may argue that Obama only accomplished so much but I would point out that Republicans in the senate often blocked what he was trying to do. And at the very least, his stimulus plan worked, setting up a strong economy for Trump admin to build on. One might argue that progress has been made under Trump but I would respectfully disagree and point out the ways that our country is back-pedaling. 
- What kinds of progress would I personally like to see? 
  1 - Worldwide data privacy laws: It is a scary concept that anyone with knowledge of Javascript and data models can steal our data so easily. On top of that I could potentially go into your friends accounts and take their data too. Before you go calling anyone a 'sheep' understand that until there are data privacy laws worldwide... we are all sheep. 
  2 - America is capable of being self sufficient in terms of energy. Conservatives have been sold this story that a shift from fossil fuels to reuseable energy would tank the economy. That is not the case, in fact this shift would be like the next industrial revolution. There would be massive growth and an array of new job opportunities that would require the same skills needed in fossil fuel industry. Hydraulics, engineering, General labor to name a few.. This shift would ensure a bright future for the our children with many new opportunities. Other countries are already making this transition. No more wars for oil! 
  3 - America is capable of providing affordable healthcare to all CITIZENS without going full on socialism. Providing affordable healthcare to ALL would certainly be a challenge because of our population, but even that is doable. This is why Obamacare ultimately failed, but with a few tweaks... it could work. The word 'Socialism' has become a scare word but not one of the Democratic nominees supported the idea of socialism and everything that a socialist government entails.
  4 - Find a way to address gun violence without killing the 2nd amendment. I know this is a bit more on the radical side but it is just my opinion that a torture penalty be in place for individuals that commits mass murder. This penalty would be reserved for the truly heinous crimes, the caught red handed crimes. The individual would need to be found guilty beyond the shadow of a doubt. Put something like this in place and we will see a significant decrease in violence. Laws/restrictions regarding extended magazines would be nice too. 

So my question to all of you is this.. Are we voting for Trump because of his policies, if so, which policies appeal to you?... or are we voting red out of pure hatred for the Democratic party? 

There is certainly room to criticize what Democrats are directly responsible for in previous years but you all should consider that your perception of the Democratic party has been skewed. People need to be aware of a company called 'Cambridge Analytica'. Take some time to understand the role this company played in Brexit and the 2016 American election. Who hired them?
Their business model: Create a pshycological profile on every voter using data collected from social media platforms (No platform is safe) Once they had this information they were able to use algorithms to feed us often misleading or false information so that we would percieve the world as they wanted us to see it. This is still happening today so I wonder who is behind it. WORLDWIDE Data Privacy laws, it has to be worldwide or there is no point.

I think it is going to be a long time before America recovers from the misleading information that has been fed to us. People do not like to admit when they have been decieved or duped. 

I believe that a good president is someone who can unite both sides under common goals. America will not be great until we are UNITED. Show me a Republican candidate that displays decency, acknowledges science and addresses even one item on my list... that is when I will vote red.
