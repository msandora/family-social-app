I joined this community in hopes of better understanding the appeal of the Trump Presidency. 
Before I continue, I want you to know...
- I consider myself a progressive independent 
- I leans left only because it is more likely that progress will be made with dem in office. One might argue that progress has been but I would argue that our country is back-pedaling in many areas. 
- Want kind of progress would I like to see? 
  1 - America is capable of being self sufficient in terms of energy. Conservatives have been sold this story that a shift from fossil fuels to reuseable energy would tank the economy. That is not the case, in fact this shift would be like the next industrial revolution. There would be massive growth and an array of new job opportunities that would require the same skills needed in fossil fuel industry. Hydraulics, engineering, General labor to name a few. This shift would ensure a bright future for the our children with many opportunities. 
  2 - America is completely capable of providing affordable healthcare to all citizens without going full on socialism.
